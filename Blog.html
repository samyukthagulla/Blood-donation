            <p class="mt-5 text-light">Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs.During apheresis, you are hooked up to a machine that collects and separates different parts of your blood. These blood components include red cells, plasma and platelets. The machine then returns the remaining parts of the blood back to you.

                Platelet donation (plateletpheresis) collects only platelets. Platelets are the cells that help stop bleeding by clumping and forming plugs in blood vessels (clotting).
                
                Donated platelets are commonly given to people with clotting problems or cancer and people who will have organ transplants or major surgeries.
                
                Double red cell donation allows you to donate a concentrated amount of red blood cells. Red blood cells deliver oxygen to your organs and tissues.
                
                Donated red blood cells are typically given to people with severe blood loss, such as after an injury or accident, and people with anemia (low hemoglobin).
                
                Plasma donation (plasmapheresis) collects the liquid portion of the blood (plasma). Plasma helps blood clot and contains antibodies that help fight off infections.
                
                Plasma is commonly given to people in emergency and trauma situations to help stop bleeding.The gift of blood helps save lives, and the demand for blood and blood products is great. 
                Every 2 seconds, someone in the U.S. needs blood, and more than 50,000 units of blood are needed each year at Cedars-Sinai alone.
